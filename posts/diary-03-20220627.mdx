**Problem:** the approaches(use word replacement,where only one word in the original sentence is replaced with another word to form a sentence pair) remains an outstanding issue.

The paper propose CAT, a novel word-replacement-based approach, whose basic idea is to identify word replacement with controlled impact(referred to as isotopic replacement)

- Machine Translation Testing:
  More approaches focus on **testing the correctness of machine translators**. The major differences lie in the heuristics adopted in these approaches.

  - based on cross-reference:
    - ① checking whether the **direct translation** (from a source language to a target language) and the **indirect translation** (from the source language to an intermediate language and then from the intermediate language to the target language) of the same sentence produce the same results.<br/>
      ② check whether the translation between different translation systems produce the similar translation results.
  - The mainstream approaches test correctness via the combination of input mutation and metamorphic relation 
    - [Testing Machine Translation via Referential Transparency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10361):breaks the original sentence into phrases and checks whether some phrases alone have different translations compared with their translations for the original sentence.

- Oracles:
  In computing, software engineering, and software testing, a test oracle (or just oracle) is a mechanism for determining whether a test has passed or failed.The use of oracles involves comparing the output(s) of the system under test, for a given test-case input, to the output(s) that the oracle determines that product should have.

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

The fact that there can never be nothingness means the universe, and anything possibly beyond it, is eternal, as something has always been around. Whatever we consider to be before the Big Bang—God, the universe in infinitesimal form, or both—one thing is certain: it was there.
